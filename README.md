This is a Copy of my Semester Project 2 i did at Noroff. (The original project used a local API, this one has a live API)

## Description

We was tasked to build an e-commerce website. Theme for the website was my own to choose.

- Search bar to filter productes by title or description


Details page
This page is reached by a user clicking on a prudct on the pruct list page.

- title, description, image, price
- an add to cart button, this will toggle the product in and out of a cart array stored in local storage.

Cart/Basket page

- List of product in your cart/basket
- total price of the products in the cart/basket
